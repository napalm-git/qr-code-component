# QR CODE COMPONENT

**My Attempt at FrontEnd Mentor | QR Code component Challenge**

In this project i utilize SCSS to style my page.

It is a single component consist of a qr code image and below that its explanation.

To be consistent and to calculate px to rem easily i utilized 62.5% trick so in turn default pixel becomes 10px. 

With that in mind font size's for h1 is 1.8rem and for paragraph it's 1.5rem.

All the colors and font-family that were used in this project come from the styleguide file obtained from the challenge website.
